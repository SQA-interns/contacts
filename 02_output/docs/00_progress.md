The handover between sessions. Every session reads it first and updates it last.

## Last session
- Session: S6 /review INC-2
- Result: done
- Gate: DoD-I not met for INC-2 (DoD-I-02: F-14 High open); DoD-I-01, -03 met, DoD-I-04 met with exceptions F-20, F-21
- Notes for the next session: review is `docs/04_review-INC-2.md` (range `333e0e1..HEAD`). F-14 High (US-021, also US-001): `FirebaseTokenFilter` asks Firebase `getUser` for every new User, and `FirebaseConfig` has no credentials, so in production the first `GET /me` of every new person probably answers 500, not only the account deletion (D-63 a); the emulator hides it. The `/implement US-021` session starts with that as a BLOCKING decision (supply credentials in `FirebaseConfig` and the production setup, which needs the human, or ask Firebase only where a deleted account matters) and stops until it is answered. Medium: F-15 (merge with `attributes: [null]` answers 500, `MergeValues.java:92-99`, US-026), F-16 (dismissal with `contactIds: [null]` answers 500, `DuplicateService.java:45`, US-025), F-17 (US-012 restore toast has no role `status`, fails E2E-05 and E2E-06, `TrashPage.tsx:41`), F-18 (`decisions-log.md` has D-67 twice and two contradicting D-68, lines 741-783). Carried: F-03, F-04, F-13 open; F-10 closed. Low (release notes): F-19 (merge into an unchanged Survivor keeps its version, needs the human), F-20, F-21, F-22. Evidence: 42 screenshots in `logs/screens/review-INC-2/`, scripts in `logs/review-INC-2/`. The test stack still runs with extra test users and Groups from the review. Spotless: `./mvnw -B -Pquality spotless:apply`. Backend acceptance runs need port 9099 free (stop `contact-groups-test-emulator-1`, start it again after); UI runs need `scripts/test-stack.sh up` first; run the specs with `--project=chromium`. Commit subjects: count the hash too, at most 72 characters.

## Next
