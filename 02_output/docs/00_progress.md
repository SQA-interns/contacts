# Progress

> For: agent (writes), human (reads) · Written in: every session · Format: `AGENTS.md` ("Handover format") · Agent: writes

The handover between sessions. Every session reads it first and updates it last.

## Last session
- Session: S8 /fix (loop 1)
- Result: done
- Gate: phase 6 gate not passed yet: fixes made, nothing re-verified (F-40 E2E, hidden evaluation, NFR script wait for `/verify` run 2); F-42, F-43, F-44 probed without finding a defect, so not shown fixed
- Notes for the next session: see D-84 and the resolution column of `docs/06_verification-report.md`. Fixed: F-40 (new Group opens its Contact list), F-41 (non-text value in a text field is 400), F-45 (`/health` is `application/json`), F-46 (backup and restore scripts, `perf/measure.mjs`, `docs/openapi.json` with `tools/export-openapi.mjs`, install and backup guide, Slovene user guide), F-53 `EX-019-03`, F-54; `ConcurrentSaveIT` for F-50. Open: F-47, F-48, F-50 rest, F-51, F-52, F-53 subjects. `/verify` must run E2E-01..06, the UI checks and `perf/measure.mjs` on the test stack, which needs port 8080: the human's production stack holds it and must be stopped again with the human's consent, then restarted. Full backend run: only the known `EX-007-05` fails. Nothing pushed.

## Next
- Command: /verify
- Waiting for: D-68 d (F-19)
