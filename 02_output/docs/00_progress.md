The handover between sessions. Every session reads it first and updates it last.

## Last session
- Session: S5 /implement US-025
- Result: done
- Gate: DoD-S passed in part for US-025 (DoD-S-01: the 9 frozen backend tests pass, there is no frozen UI test; the rest of the full run fails as before; DoD-S-05 screens)
- Notes for the next session: D-67 records the readings. `POST /groups/{g}/duplicates/dismissals` is in `DuplicateController` and `DuplicateService.dismiss`; `find` hides sets through `domain.DismissedSets` (a set is hidden when all its Contacts are in one dismissed set, D-67 a) fed by `DismissalRepository`; an unknown set answers 404 `duplicate.not_found`. UI: `features/duplicates/DismissButton` on every set card of `DuplicatesPage`, `api/duplicates.ts` `dismissDuplicate`. For US-026 (last story of INC-2): the page still has no pick boxes and no "Združi izbrane (n)" button; `DuplicateSet.contacts` come oldest first; the merge route, `MergeController`, `MergeService` and the frozen `Us026`, `e2e-05` and five US-026 UI tests are still failing for the missing endpoint. Open from the review as before: F-03, F-04, F-10, F-13 and Low F-06, F-07, F-11, F-12; HUMAN, BEFORE PRODUCTION: Firebase Admin credentials (D-63 a); known failing frozen UI tests of INC-1: AC-003-07, AC-004-04, AC-004-08, AC-005-06 (D-62 h). Spotless needs `./mvnw -B -Pquality spotless:apply` (without `-Pquality` the goal is not found). A `mvnw verify -Dit.test=...` exits 1 on a stale failsafe summary and two classes of different kinds in one `-Dit.test` clash on the Firebase app; read `target/failsafe-reports/TEST-*.xml`. Backend acceptance runs need port 9099 free (stop `contact-groups-test-emulator-1`, then start it again; it runs now). Run gitleaks at the repository root. Screens: `logs/screens/WF-17_duplicates`. Commit subjects: count the hash too, the subject alone must stay at 72 characters.

## Next
