The handover between sessions. Every session reads it first and updates it last.

## Last session
- Session: S6 /quality-gate
- Result: done
- Gate: phase 5 gate met in part: backend meets both thresholds (line 97.62 %, mutation 97.37 %); frontend meets the line threshold (97.77 %) and misses the mutation threshold by 7.57 points (82.43 %, three survivor rounds done, D-82, F-38)
- Notes for the next session: figures and the sets of tests run are in `docs/03_test-strategy.md` ("Test measures", "Quality gate", "Phase 5 notes"). D-81: PIT ran in five runs with disjoint test sets (one `FirebaseApp` per JVM, fixed emulator port) and the results were merged by mutant; frontend nonUnit coverage is not measured. D-82 carries F-38 (Medium, frontend mutation shortfall; 330 more mutants, mainly in ten screens) and F-39 (Low, `TagListPage` asks for Tags before the Role is known); neither is fixed. Known failing frozen tests unchanged: backend `EX-007-05`, `AC-018-15` (fails in Failsafe, passed in PIT), UI acceptance 7, E2E-01 and E2E-03 (not re-run in S6). Test commits of the survivor rounds are over 400 lines (D-82 d). 585 frontend unit tests pass. Reports: `backend/target/pit-reports/`, `frontend/reports/mutation/` (not committed). The dev stack is untouched.

## Next
- Command: /verify
- Waiting for: D-68 d (F-19)
